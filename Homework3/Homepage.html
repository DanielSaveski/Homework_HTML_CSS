        <h2>Different Types of Throwing Axes</h2>
        <p>Hundreds of axe types have been used throughout human history, although some are better for throwing than others. In this section, we're going to discuss what types of axes are used for throwing:</p>

                <h2>Hatchets</h2>
                <p>There are many different types of hatchets, each of which has a specific use. Small hatchets, also known as forest axes, are generally designed to cut through tree branches and other small obstacles. They tend to weigh only a few pounds, and their length is around a foot, sometimes a little more.

                    Hatchets are considered a general all-purpose axe and are the kind that many people use for light jobs around their property. They are small compared to many other types of axes and feature a chunky handle commonly made of hickory. The head of a hatchet is weighted and features a sharp blade. A high-quality hatchet has a balanced feel, which helps the user swing and cut accurately.</p>

                <h2>Tomahawk</h2>
                <p>The tomahawk, which is generally lighter and thinner than a hatchet, was created and first used by Native American tribes, although their tomahawks were not originally made with metal. Before the Europeans arrived in the New World, Native Americans had never even seen iron tools. After the Europeans conquered the continent, they traded with the natives, and “trade axes” played a significant role. Relatively light and small axes that could be easily attached to the belt were popular among Europeans, and they quickly became popular with the Native Americans as well, who used them for hunting, fighting and domestic work.

                    This type of axe, which has been given the collective name “tomahawk,” has become a symbol of Native Americans, largely due to an inaccurate image of these tribes propagated by European colonists and, later, Hollywood.
                    
                    Today, tomahawks have many uses. They are similar to hatchets in that they can be used for simple camping tasks and for cutting through tree branches and brush. However, their smaller size and lightweight nature make them preferable to hatchets in many situations.
                    
                    Their versatility also makes them useful in specific wartime operations. Tomahawks feature a straight handle, which allows them to be released easily to throw at an enemy in combat.
                    
                    Tomahawks are also frequently found in axe throwing establishments, although hatchets are more common.</p>

                <h2>Splitting Axe</h2>
                 <p>Splitting axes, also known as splitting mauls, are primarily used for splitting and chopping up firewood. They feature a long wooden handle, which gives the user the leverage needed to produce a powerful swing. When you use a splitting axe, your swing should be downward, not sideways, as is the case with a felling axe.

                    Splitting axes also have a heavy, large head ground into a concave shape with a somewhat thin edge. The splitting axe's concave shape makes sure that the edge goes easily and quickly into the wood and then splits it as the wider part of the axe head pushes the wood apart. This design also keeps the axe head from sticking easily into the wood, which is what would happen with slimmer axe heads.
                    
                    This axe is designed to cut along the grain, unlike hatchets and felling axes, which are designed to cut across the grain.</p>

                <h2>Double-Bit Axe</h2>
                <p>This double-edged axe was most often used by forest workers in the United States and Canada up until the chainsaw superseded it in the middle of the 20th century. It features two edges, one ground finely and the other a little bit blunter. The finer edge was used for felling trees, whereas the other one was meant for limbing. In other words, it doubled as both a felling axe and as a hatchet, which allowed workers to do everything they needed without lugging around two axes. The double-bit axe became so widespread that it even came to be a symbol of North American forest workers.

                    As the forest workers who used these axes typically worked in remote areas for several months at a time and didn't have a wide variety of entertainment options, they would often spend their leisure time throwing these axes at targets, usually the ends of logs.
                    
                    These days, the double-bit axe is rarely used in the forest and is primarily used as a competition throwing axe, such as in the <a href="https://lumberjackworldchampionships.com/" target="_blank">Lumberjack World Championships</a> .</p>

                <h2>Felling Axe</h2>
                <p>Felling axes are designed specifically to fell trees and chop wood logs. A felling axe features a long handle and head weighing several pounds. The felling axe's long handle gives the user more leverage, allowing them to swing with more power and make a better cut. Felling axe handles have traditionally been made of hickory wood, one of the strongest woods available. If shopping for a felling axe, make sure the wood grain follows the axe handle lengthways and curves with it, as this will ensure superior strength.

                    Felling axes feature blades with a thin and sharp tip, which are designed for cutting against the grain. Therefore, if felling a tree, swing the axe sideways at the trunk. Felling axes are great for felling branches and small trees but do not work well for splitting, as the sharp blade will easily get stuck.
                    
                    Although felling axe's size and weight do not make them one of the best throwing axe types, they are actually used in “big axe throws,” which serve to break ties in IATF-sanctioned axe-throwing competitions.</p>
